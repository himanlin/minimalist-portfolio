                Focusing on health professionals’ tweets regarding COVID-19, this study examines whether and how the professionals’ tweets are unique based on their identity as health experts. The data revealed that the infusion of health communication with political opinions, whether pro- or against certain political parties or health policies, is value-laden and may deviate from the original purpose of health communication. In addition, the sentiment analysis countered the intuitive thoughts that health experts are merely fulfilling their role as “neutral encyclopedias” without overly carrying any sentiments. We conclude by reflecting on the meaning of health communication inrelation to the professionals’ political stances.

                  Social dilemmas frequently arise in daily life, in which individuals' rational choices often lead to the worst outcomes for society. Peer pressure has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem, whereby individuals are subject to reduced payoffs when they are in the minority within a group. This study utilizes agent-based models to investigate how peer pressure can enhance cooperative behavior in individuals playing a public goods game in structured populations. The study examines the impact of collective actions when individuals belong to different social groups with varying degrees of homophily. And we also analyze the influence of peer pressure, originating from an individual's neighborhood rather than their assigned group attribute, in different importance weighting settings. The results indicate that increased levels of peer pressure can lead to a greater likelihood of cooperators dominating the game, requiring a lower threshold of synergy. Additionally, homophily can further enhance cooperative behavior. Thus, the findings suggest that cooperative behavior in collective action problems can more easily emerge when individuals face greater peer pressure and in scenarios where they have a higher tendency to associate with similar others.

               How do athletic labor markets become globalized? Agentbased simulations of club recruitment behavior in the worldwide market for football talent
              </summary>

                Sport sociologists typically argue that the labor market in professional football globalized, because teams increasingly recruit internationally either from historically linked socio-linguistically similar countries, through global value-added chains, or following a disaggregated strategy combining frequent local hiring with occasional global recruitment. To compare the plausibility of these three distinct theoretical ideas about how clubs drive the globalization of the football labor market, we simulate the recruitment activities of professional football clubs with a series of agent-based simulations. Simulations where clubs follow disaggregated recruitment strategies best approximate the composition of footballers from core, semi-peripheral, and peripheral countries observed in European football. In contrast, simulations where teams recruit in historically linked peripheral countries or where teams funnel cheap labor from the Global South through global value-added chains both over-estimate the globalization of the labor force in European football. The simulations thus suggest that theories portraying teams as supplementing domestic recruitment with occasional global hiring best explain how Europe’s football labor market globalized.
